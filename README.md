## üìÑ Description - Exercise Statement

### Exercise 1

Create a class called **Month** with an attribute "**name**" (which will store the name of the month of the year). Add 11 **Month** objects (each with its different attribute) into an **ArrayList**, with the exception of the object with the attribute "**Agost**" (August). Then, perform the insertion in the correct position for that month and demonstrate that the **ArrayList** maintains the correct order.

Convert the **ArrayList** from the previous exercise into a **HashSet** and ensure that it does not allow duplicates.

Iterate through the list using a `for` loop and an **iterator**.

### Exercise 2

Create and populate a `List<Integer>`.

Create a second `List<Integer>` and insert the elements of the first list into the second list in **reverse order**.

Use **ListIterator** objects to read the elements of the first list and insert them into the second.

### Exercise 3

Given the file **countries.txt** (check the resources section) which contains countries and capitals. The program must read the file and store the data in a `HashMap<String, String>`. The program asks for the user's name, and then must randomly display a country stored in the **HashMap**. The user must write the name of the capital of the country in question. If they guess correctly, they get one point. This action is repeated 10 times. Once the capitals of 10 random countries have been requested, the user's name and their score must be saved in a file called **classificacio.txt**.
